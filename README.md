# Introducing web4thejob #

Web4thejob is an open source java framework for the rapid development of data-centric web applications. It is ideal for those who seek a component-based event-driven web development framework, capable of producing elegant desktop-style web applications that can automate any business domain.

The framework addresses the automation needs of business domains introducing "[joblets](http://web4thejob.org/f-a-q/30-what-is-a-joblet "What is a joblet?")". A joblet encapsulates the relational schema of a business model using modern ORM technology. Joblets are meant to be released by members of the Community under the licensing terms of their preference (free or proprietary). By definition joblets guarantee productivity through reusability.

The framework is engineered in a multi-layered architecture on top on some of the most [recognized open source projects of the global java community](http://web4thejob.org/f-a-q/35-which-are-the-architectural-characteristics "Which are the architectural characteristics?"); consequently a steep learning curve, a plethora of documentation and an open architecture for binding with other projects are ensured.
